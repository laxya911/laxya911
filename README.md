# Hi — I’m Laxya 👋
DevOps Engineer • Helping startups & small businesses automate cloud infrastructure, delivery, and operations. Available for freelance and short-term engagements.

---

## About
I design and deliver practical, cost-effective DevOps solutions that let teams ship faster and operate more reliably. I handle the day‑to‑day responsibilities of a DevOps engineer: CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud setup & migration, containerization, observability, security hardening, and operational runbooks.

I focus on pragmatic automation that reduces manual toil, improves deployment safety, and provides clear, versioned infrastructure your team can own.

---

## Services I Offer
- CI/CD design and implementation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation)  
- Cloud architecture, provisioning & migration (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Containerization & orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes — EKS/GKE/AKS)  
- Configuration management & automation (Ansible, Helm)  
- Observability, logging & alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK / OpenSearch)  
- Security best practices, compliance support, and secrets management  
- Cost optimization, autoscaling, and resource right-sizing  
- On-call/runbook setup, incident response playbooks, and operational handover

---

## Typical Engagements & Deliverables
- End-to-end CI/CD pipelines with testing, approvals, and rollback strategies  
- Codified infrastructure (IaC) for reproducible environments (dev/stage/prod)  
- Cloud migration plans and execution (lift & shift, replatforming)  
- Kubernetes rollout and GitOps pipelines  
- Documentation, runbooks, and handover for ongoing maintenance  
- SLO-driven monitoring and alerting with practical runbooks

---

## Who I Work With
Startups, small businesses, and product teams that need practical DevOps expertise without the overhead of hiring a full-time operations team. I prioritize ROI, speed, and solutions that scale as you grow.
